All raw data for analysis are found in the raw data file. In this file you will find the CSV files that have Te, Tb, Tsurf, and Tsel for individual lizards. 
There is one .rds file where it is 'Tsurf_field' which are data from accelerometers of animals in the field.

Final_analysis folder has all the final data that are used in the models and scripts to produce these files are in the root directory (Tb_and_biophsical_Te_comparison.R & Tset_Tb_E_TPC_Survival).
These two scripts are then used to summarize and then analyze the data that produce the final figures in the folder 'final.figures'. These scripts also save the final models used in 
the results section and are saved in the folder 'models'. 

Finally in the root directory you will find a markdown file 'Figures.Rmd' that will produce all of the final figures, tables, and supplementary information used in the manuscript.
